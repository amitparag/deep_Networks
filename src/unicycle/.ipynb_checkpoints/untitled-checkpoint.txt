TODO

1. Plot 3D scatter plots of starting points vs control and value.
2. Plot 2D projections of the above, projected onto x, y plane.
3. Train the net.
4. Redo 1 and 2 but this time with init_xs, init_us. 


A few points:

    Vary the cost weights.
    While warmstarting, use either or both initial guesses for xs and us.
    use double relu and then tanh
